# Signadot Go SDK

This repository houses the Signadot Go SDK, a Signadot API library
generated with swagger.

NOTE: This SDK is still in development and may be changed in ways that break consumers.

## Generation

The directory `generate` contains all sources for generating the code.
See the Makefile there.
